# Implicit-Emotion-Detection

Emotion classification in natural language processing (NLP) is a complex task due to the context-sensitive and nuanced nature of emotional expressions. Subtle emotions, in particular, can be difficult to interpret, as they often depend on cultural, situational, and linguistic factors. While much of the existing research focuses on identifying explicit emotional cues, such as clear indicators of happiness, anger, or sadness, detecting implicit emotions poses a significant challenge in real-world applications where emotions are often indirectly conveyed. 

To address this gap, this project introduces a novel methodology that leverages external knowledge bases to enhance the understanding of emotional expressions in language. Knowledge bases, which store structured factual information about concepts, relationships, and real-world events, serve as a valuable resource for augmenting language models. By integrating this external information, the proposed approach aims to capture the underlying context and subtle emotional cues that are often missed by traditional NLP models. This integration enhances the modelâ€™s ability to classify both explicit and implicit emotions, making it more effective for practical applications.
